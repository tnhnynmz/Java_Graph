# Java_Graph_Node
 Create a directed graph whose directions are constructed from ‘source’ to ‘destination’ with the given ‘edge-weight’ value.
 Program asks the user for a source and a destination name. Code will run to find maximum number of packages can be transferred from source to destination branches 
provided by the user.
Main Tasks:
1- What is the maximum number of packages that can be transferred from source to
destination in one day?
2- Which edges’ capacity should be increased at first to increase the number of received
packages at the destination branch?
3- How much should we maximize these edges found in the task 2?
